# Security
The Xigadee framework has been developed to ensure a highest degree of security when constructing a distributed application.

This includes in-flight encryption of transmission messaging, and a detailed support to ensure encrypted logging and storage of sensitive information.

The framework also uses JWT token based authentication as its default mechanism for authenticating not just web based clients, but for authenticating communication between Microservices.

This is done through intuitive pipeline-based configuration commands.
